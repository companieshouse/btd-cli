// parseCmd represents the parse command
var parseCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "parse",
	Short: "Parse business transaction data into a human-readable format",
	Long: `Parse the content of a file or command-line argument string containing
business transaction data (BTD) into a human-readable output format. Use the
subcommands 'file' and 'string' to read the transaction data from a file or string
argument respectively.

When parsing the content of a file, each line within the file is assumed to
contain a complete business transaction data string.

String arguments must be quoted (single or double) when using the 'data'
subcommand.

Examples:
  btd-cli parse data '...'
  btd-cli parse file <path>`,
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(parseCmd)
}
